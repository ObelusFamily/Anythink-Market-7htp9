# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_


- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Install docker in your local from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Once the docker is installed , open your terminal and run `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v` to verify if docker is ready.
- After that run `docker-compose up` from your projects root directory to load frontend and backend.
- If Docker is running correctly , then you can test the backend by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping
- If everything is working properly, youâ€™ll be able to create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register
